The Classes folder contains a library for reading Excel files.

The conn folder contains a php file with the connection to the SQL server.

index.php: Reads input from a barcode reader with an order number or item. Checks if the inputed data  is from an order, if so, it sets it as active. Then it takes the data with all the components that are included in its creation from the database and loads them into an "itemlist" array. Some of these components are specifically for SMD assembly and are in an Excel file with 2 sheets. Each sheet is for an assembly side sheet 1 is side A, sheet 2 is side B. This file contains information about the loading position of the SMD machine of this component and its name. These components are loaded into an "itemlistsmd" array. And the component position number is loaded into an array checkitemlistsmd for sheet1 and checkitemlistsmd2 for sheet 2 and with the positions creates 2 option fields loaded with all positions for both sides. If the input data is not an order, it checks whether it is a component and is part of the "itemlist" array. If is not it gives an error signal with a red flashing light. Then it checks whether it is part of the Excel file and checks the selected position from the page form. If it does not find a match, it gives an error signal with a red flashing light. If it finds a match, it marks the position in checkitemlistsmd or checkitemlistsmd2 as checked and gives a short 10 second signal for successful input of a component with a green flashing light. For a specific position there can be more than 1 component (there are alternatives) and therefore in the checkitemlistsmd or checkitemlistsmd2 arrays one position can exist several times and all are cleared when 1 of these items matches. An order is considered completed if all positions are checked and then a signal is given for a successfully completed order with a flashing green light.

positiongenerator.php: Reads input from a barcode reader. Checks whether the read data is in order in the NAVISION system (SQL database). If it is, creates an Excel file with a template in a specified directory where the operator can enter the positions and items for SMD assembly that are included in index.php
