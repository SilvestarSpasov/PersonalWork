Rules of Sudoku

Rule 1 - Each row must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetitions
The player must focus on filling each row of the grid while ensuring there are no duplicated numbers. The placement order of the digits is irrelevant.
 
Every puzzle, regardless of the difficulty level, begins with allocated numbers on the grid. The player should use these numbers as clues to find which digits are missing in each row.

Rule 2 - Each column must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetitions
The Sudoku rules for the columns on the grid are exactly the same as for the rows. The player must also fill these with the numbers from 1 to 9, making sure each digit occurs only once per column.
 
The numbers allocated at the beginning of the puzzle work as clues to find which digits are missing in each column and their position.

Rule 3 - The digits can only occur once per block (nonet)
A regular 9 x 9 grid is divided into 9 smaller blocks of 3 x 3, also known as nonets. The numbers from 1 to 9 can only occur once per nonet.
 
In practice, this means that the process of filling the rows and columns without duplicated digits finds inside each block another restriction to the numbersâ€™ positioning.




How to play:
Fill in the number of missing squares in the puzzle and press the New Puzzle button. Then select the number you want to fill in from the number menu and click on a box from the puzzle as the initially generated puzzle cannot be changed.	
The "C" button deletes the selected box from the puzzle, as the initially generated puzzle cannot be deleted. The restart button clears all player filled puzzle fields and the originally generated puzzle remains. From the game menu you can choose the color of the next filling of a field of the puzzle. You can also choose "dark mode" and language (EN or BG).
